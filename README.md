## üìù Project Summary

This project provides a comprehensive, end-to-end customer analytics solution using the Online Retail II dataset. It transforms over one million raw transactional records into actionable business insights. The core of this project involves:

*   **RFM Segmentation:** Identifying distinct customer segments such as "Champions" and "At-Risk" by analyzing their **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary** value to enable targeted marketing strategies.
*   **Predictive Churn Modeling:** Building and deploying an **XGBoost** model to proactively identify customers with a high probability of churning, and analyzing the key factors that drive this behavior.
*   **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Forecasting:** Implementing probabilistic models (**BG/NBD** and **Gamma-Gamma**) to predict the future purchasing behavior and monetary value of customers, guiding long-term strategic investments.
*   **Statistical A/B Testing:** Designing and executing a simulated A/B test to statistically measure the impact of a discount campaign on customer spending, using the **Mann-Whitney U test** for significance.

## üéØ Project Objectives

The main business objectives of this project are:

*   Identify the most valuable customer segments and their common characteristics.
*   Pinpoint customers at high risk of churn and understand the factors influencing this risk.
*   Estimate the future value (CLV) of customers to guide marketing budget allocation.
*   Determine the effectiveness of a marketing campaign on increasing customer spending.

| Feature     | Description                                                                   | Type         |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| `Invoice`   | A 6-digit nominal, unique for each transaction. 'C' indicates a cancellation. | `object`     |
| `StockCode` | A unique code assigned to each distinct product.                              | `object`     |
| `Description`| The name of the product.                                                      | `object`     |
| `Quantity`  | The number of units of a product sold in a transaction.                       | `int64`      |
| `InvoiceDate`| The date and time when the transaction occurred.                              | `object` |
| `Price`     | The unit price of the product in British Pounds (¬£).                          | `float64`    |
